    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

    <p>In my free time, I dive into the worlds of manga and anime, where I find endless inspiration and entertainment.
      Reading manga allows me to escape into different stories and connect with characters whose journeys captivate me.
      Watching anime is another passion, where the blend of art, storytelling, and emotion never fails to engage my imagination.
      Alongside these interests, I cherish the moments spent bonding with my pets—Shuku, Shadow, and Dino. Whether it’s playing, relaxing, or just being in their company, they bring a sense of joy and companionship that completes my day.
      These hobbies not only provide me with relaxation and enjoyment but also deepen my appreciation for creativity and the simple pleasures in life.</p>
